These sessions provide an introduction to practical statistical methods
applied to genomics data, including data handling and quality control,
 dimension reduction, hypothesis testing and estimation, understanding
confidence intervals and dealing with multiple testing.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

-   Those who have less experience in Statistics, become confident in
    developing a hypothesis, choosing a test and implementing it to
    their data to find if significant or not.
-   Those who have less experience in working with biological datasets,
    get experience working with genotype data, gene expression data and
    raw experimental data from qPCR experiments.
-   Use of confidence intervals, what to use and how to assess them in
    reported research.
-   How to use dimension reduction methods to get an initial first look
    at the data
-   The perils of multiple testing and the methods to test significance
    when doing lots of tests.
